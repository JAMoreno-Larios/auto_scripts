Download cygwin
Run installer and select “install from internet”
When asked for a mirror, any will work, but http://mirrors.kernel.org is fast
Run installer. When it says to select packages, install the defaults, but also type “rsync” in the search window and select these:
rsync
librsync2
Then search for openssh and install “openssh”


Now open a cygwin terminal and try to SSH to your linux box:
ssh luke@10.49.150.110
(or whatever)
 After that, make and install an SSH key so you won’t need a password for rsync

If you still need a password even after you install the key, try this:
